# Project: Data Warehouse
## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

### Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.
### Project Datasets
You will be working with two datasets residing in S3:
- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
This dataset is a subset of real data from the [**Million Song Dataset**](http://millionsongdataset.com). Each file in JSON format and contain metadata about song and artists of that song. The file also are partitioned by the first 3 letters of each song's track id
`song_data/A/A/...`

- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
This dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by [**event simulator**](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. This simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration setting. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month

- Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`
